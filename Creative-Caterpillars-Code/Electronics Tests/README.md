IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ALL OF THIS


In order for any of these to work you must download the actual library. I don't know if it's legal for me to post a download link so
I will just tell you to get it from your teacher's page. Once you have it downloaded you need to import it by clicking "Sketch"

then "Include library"

then "Add .zip library"

and finally select the thing you just downloaded.
