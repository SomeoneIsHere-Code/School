/* 
Since I can't actually code in our arduino and don't know 
what the inputs and outputs are I'm going to create as much of the
logic today as I can while making it easy on myself to add in the pins
and everything once we have that set in stone

In my usual style I'm going to probably over comment and use way too 
may variables and functions but it's how I code
